# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Application Description

I am pleased to bring you the final version of my workday task schedule application. This was my first time creating a web application using jQuery and API's, and it was a challange that I thoroughly enjoyed. I made this web application because I found that my calendar was full of all "big" events, however many of the small day to day tasks were falling through the cracks because they werent written down anywhere. In order to build my coding skills, and solve my issue, this application was made.

## Deployment

Project Repository URL: https://github.com/gregorywyrick/workday-scheduler
Live Website URL: https://gregorywyrick.github.io/workday-scheduler/

## Installation

There is no installation required to run this application aside from the web browser of your choosing, as this is a web application. 

## Usage

To use this application, simply enter the URl where the project is hosted. Once on the page you will be able to click on each of the boxes next to each time slot. After choosing the hour of day, you are able to type whatever task you would like into the field. After filling out that information, the user then clicks the save button to the right of the selected box. Upon clicking the save button, the user will be given an alert that the text has been saved. (See screenshots below for reference)
